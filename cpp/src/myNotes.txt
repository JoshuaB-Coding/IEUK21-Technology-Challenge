Notes:
	- Had to alter the 'showAllPlaylist' test in the 'part2_test.cpp' file to
	  make the script test the playlist order correctly. For some reason, that
	  test wasn't asking for the order in which playlists were created, which
	  is why I changed it.
	- The tests containing 'containsRegex' for the playRandom tests in 
	  'part1_test.cpp' will not run in my IDE. For some reason, it doesn't
	  recognise the '|' character in the 'containsRegex' function, so
	  this keeps showing me that it fails these tests for that reason.
	  However, I have tested the 'playRandom' function extensively and
	  have found that it works (the only 'issue' with it is that the random
	  numbers are the same for every test as the seed doesn't change).

The code for this project is very clunky and could be made a lot prettier. I
am going to spend more time cleaning up this code in my own time, but I need
to get this submitted by 11 am and therefore don't have time to clean it.
This is mainly here as an apology to whomever ends up reading this code: I
wish you the best of luck in making sense of many of the things in this script.
